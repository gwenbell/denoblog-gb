Hi world, my name is Gwendolyn. I now live in NC in a place where I am learning to respond correctly to having MS. I want to give a shout out to Nicole for helping me write this down. I talked to Mark, my paternal father and I just wanted to say hey!

I also want to say hi to Everett because he is beautiful and I miss the bleep out of him so I want to continue to say that I love to travel and I want to be on the road again one day when it is possible to safely do so. Thank you to the staff for helping me to learn what's possible.
